## What you should know before you begin {-}

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
Data tidying refers to reshaping your data into a tidy data frame or [tibble](#tidy-data). Data tidying is an important first step for your analysis because every tidyverse function will expect your data to be stored as **Tidy Data**. 
```
  
```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}  
Tidy data is tabular data organized so that:

1. Each column contains a single variable
1. Each row contains a single observation
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}  
The definition of tidy data depends on the definition of variable, which is _a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure_. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}  
With enough mental flexibility, you can consider anything to be a variable (and use anything as a variable). However, some variables will be more useful than others for any specific task. In general, if you can formulate your task as an equation (math or code that contains an equals sign), the most useful variables will be the objects in the equation.
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}  
Tidy data is not an arbitrary requirement of the tidyverse; it is the ideal data format for doing data science with R. Tidy data makes it easy to extract every value of a variable to build a plot or to compute a summary statistic. Tidy data also makes it easy to compute new variables; when your data is tidy, you can rely on R's rowwise operations to maintain the integrity of your observations. Moreover, R can directly manipulate tidy data with R's fast, built-in vectorised observations, which lets your code run as fast as possible.
```

## Create a tibble manually

You want to create a tibble from scratch by typing in the contents of the tibble.

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
tribble(~number, ~letter,   ~greek,
              1,     "a",  "alpha",
              2,     "b",   "beta",
              3,     "c",  "gamma")
```

#### Discussion {-}

`tribble()` creates a tibble while generating a preview of the result in your code. To use `tribble()`, list each column name preceded by a `~`, then list the values of the tribble in a rowwise fashion. If you take care to align your columns, the transposed syntax of `tribble()` becomes a preview of the table.

You can also create a tibble with `tibble()`, whose syntax mirrors `data.frame()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
tibble(number = c(1, 2, 3), 
       letter = c("a", "b", "c"),
       greek = c("alpha", "beta", "gamma"))
```


## Convert a data frame to a tibble

You want to convert a data frame to a tibble.

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
as_tibble(iris)
```

## Convert a tibble to a data frame

You want to convert a tibble to a data frame.

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
as.data.frame(table1)
```

#### Discussion {-}

```{block2, type = "rmdcaution"}
Be careful to use `as.data.frame()` and not `as_data_frame()`, which is an alias for `as_tibble()`.
```

## Preview the contents of a tibble

You want to get an idea of what variables and values are stored in a tibble.

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
storms
```

#### Discussion {-}

When you call a tibble directly, R will display enough information to give you a quick sense of the contents of the tibble. This includes:

1. the dimensions of the tibble
1. the column names and types
1. as many cells of the tibble as will fit comfortably in your console window

## Inspect every cell of a tibble

You want to see which values are stored in a tibble.

#### Solution {-}

```{r eval = FALSE}
View(storms)
```

#### Discussion {-}

`View()` (with a capital V) opens the tibble in R's data viewer, which will let you scroll to every cell in the tibble.


## Name data viewers inside RStudio

You want to assign custom names to several datasets you are inspecting in the data viewers.

For example,

```{r}
View(starwars)
View(storms)
View(smiths)
```

Inside RStudio, those commands open R's data viewer with default names:

#### Solution {-}

##### Option 1
```{r}
View(starwars, "starwars from dplyr")
View(storms, "storms from dplyr")
View(smiths, "smiths from tidyr")
```
##### Option 2
```{r}
starwars %>% 
  View("starwars from dplyr")
storms %>% 
  View("storms from dplyr")
smiths %>% 
  View("smiths from tidyr")
```

#### Discussion {-}

Inside `View()` you insert a R object and then the title for the data viewer. This is really unnecessary with a few datasets, but when inspecting more than 5 datasets, this comes in handy. 



## Spread a pair of columns into a field of cells

You want to **pivot**, **convert long data to wide**, or move variable names out of the cells and into the column names. These are different ways of describing the same thing.

For example, `table2` contains `type`, which is a column that repeats the variable names `case` and `population`. To make `table2` tidy, you must move `case` and `population` values into their own columns.

```{r}
table2
```

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
table2 %>% 
  spread(key = type, value = count)
```

#### Discussion {-}

To use `spread()`, assign the column that contains variable names to `key`. Assign the column that contains the values that are associated with those names to `value`. `spread()` will:

1. Make a copy of the original table
1. Remove the `key` and `value` columns from the copy
1. Remove every duplicate row in the data set that remains
1. Insert a new column for each unique variable name in the `key` column 
1. Fill the new columns with the values of the `value` column in a way that preserves each relationship between values in the original data set

Each new column created by `spread()` will inherit the data type of the `value` column. If you would like `spread()` to convert each new column to the most sensible data type given its final contents, add the argument `convert = TRUE`.

## Gather a field of cells into a pair of columns

You want to **convert wide data to long**, reshape a **two-by-two table**, or move variable values out of the column names and into the cells. These are different ways of describing the same thing.

For example, `table4a` is a two-by-two table with the column names `1999` and `2000`. These names are values of a `year` variable. The field of cells in `table4a` contains counts of TB cases, which is another variable. To make `table4a` tidy, you need to move `year` and `cases` into their own columns. 

```{r}
table4a
```

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(key = "year", value = "cases", 2:3)
```

#### Discussion {-}

`gather()` is the inverse of `spread()`: `gather()` collapses a field of cells that spans several columns into two columns:

1. A column of former "keys", which contains the column names of the former field
1. A column of former "values", which contains the cell values of the former field 

To use `gather()`, pick names for the new `key` and `value` columns, and supply them as strings. Then identify the columns to gather into the new key and value columns. `gather()` will:

1. Create a copy of the original table
1. Remove the identified columns from the copy
1. Add a key column with the supplied name
1. Fill the key column with the column names of the removed columns, repeating rows as necessary so that each combination of row and removed column name appears once
1. Add a value column with the supplied name
1. Fill the value column with the values of the removed columns in a way that preserves each relationship between values and column names in the original data set

You can identify the columns to remove by name, by index (number),  by inverse index (negative number), or by any of the [`select()` helpers](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html#useful-functions), which come in the dplyr package. So for example, the following commands will do the same thing as the solution above:

```{r eval = FALSE}
table4a %>% gather(key = "year", value = "cases", `"1999", "2000")
table4a %>% gather(key = "year", value = "cases", -1)
table4a %>% gather(key = "year", value = "cases", one_of(c("1999", "2000")))
```

By default, the new key column will contain character strings. If you would like `gather()` to convert the new key column to the most sensible data type given its final contents, add the argument `convert = TRUE`.

## Separate a column into new columns

You want to split a single column into multiple columns by separating each cell in the column into a row of cells that each contain a separate portion of the value in the original cell.  

For example, `table3` combines `cases` and `population` values in a single column named `rate`. To make `table3` tidy, you need to separate `rate` into two columns: one for the `cases` variable, one for the `population` variable.

```{r}
table3
```

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(col = rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE)
```

#### Discussion {-}

To use `separate()`, pass `col` the name of the column to split. Pass `into` a vector of names for the new columns that `col` will be split into. You should supply one name for each new column that you expect to appear in the result; a mismatch will imply that something went wrong. `separate()` will:

1. Create a copy of the original data set
1. Add a new column for each name in `into`
1. Split each value of `col` into multiple values. To do this, `separate()` will locate the positions of a separator character in each value. `separate()` will then makes the segments that appear between the separators separate (sub)values.
1. Place the resulting (sub)values into the new columns in order, one (sub)value per column
1. Remove the `col` column

Add the argument `remove = FALSE` to retain the `col` column in the final result.

By default, `separate()` will use each non-alpha-numeric character as a separator. To designate a specific separator character, pass a regular expression to `sep`. To split values into sequences that each have a specific number of characters, pass an integer vector to `sep`:

* `sep = 1` will split each value between the first and second character. 
* `sep = c(1, 3)` will split each value between the first and second character and then again between the third and fourth character.
* `sep = -1` will split each value between the last and second to last character.

Each new column created by `separate()` will inherit the data type of the `col` column. If you would like `separate()` to convert each new column to the most sensible data type given its final contents, add the argument `convert = TRUE`.

## Unite multiple columns into a single column

You want to combine several columns into a single column by uniting their values across rows.

For example, `table5` splits the `year` variable across two columns: `century` and `year`. To make `table5` tidy, you need to unite `century` and `year` into a single column.

```{r}
table5
```

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(col = "year", century, year, sep = "")
```

#### Discussion {-}

To use `unite()`, give `col` a character string to use as the name of the new column to create. Then list the columns to combine, and give `sep` a separator character to use to paste together the values in the cells of each column. `unite()` will:

1. Paste together the values of the listed columns in vectorized (i.e. rowwise) fashion. `unite()` will place `sep` between each value during the paste process.
1. Append the result as a column named `col` to a copy of the original data set
1. Remove the listed columns. To retain the columns in the result, add the argument `remove = FALSE`.

```{block2, type = "rmdcaution"}
If you do not suppy a `sep` value, `unite()` will use `_` as a separator character.
```
